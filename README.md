# Foodify - easy food management

I dislike having to figure out what to eat each week, thus I automated it with Foodify.

Foodify creates my weekly menu based on what I like and what I ate the week before.

## Features implemented
- Recipe creation
- Weekly food tracking
- Week history
- Grocery lists based on recipies in weekly plan
- Blog
- Comments
- Dashboards

## Future features
- Nutritional tracking
- Automated recipe aggregration
- Processing preferences of individual users
- Family week planning
- Pantry integration (smart fridges ftw)
- Automated ordering with online food retailers
